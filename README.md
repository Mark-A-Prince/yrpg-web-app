# yrpg-web-app
My friend has his own table-top RPG system called "YRPG". The idea is that every session is a self contained story, is silly in nature, and the twist is that the first action in every session is the group decides on 6 attributes that will comprise the character stat sheet. This application is meant to make that easier for all members, as well as help me start learning how to code with Javascript.
